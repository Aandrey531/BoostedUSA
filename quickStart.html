                <h2>Quick Start</h2>
                <span class="my-line"></span>
                <p>
                    <b>YOUR BOARD CAN LOSE POWER AND BRAKES AT ANY
                        MOMENT</b> due to radio interference, a dead remote battery,
                    unintentional release of the Engage Button, downhill overcharging
                    of a full battery, and other factors. If this happens, the board turns
                    back into an unpowered skateboard, so only ride your Boosted
                    board at speeds and on hills where you'd be comfortable without
                    power and brakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>BRAKING DOWNHILL ON A FULL BATTERY WILL CAUSE
                        BOARD SHUTDOWN</b> since the regenerative braking will
                    overcharge the battery. To prevent this from happening, the
                    remote will warn you by beeping, and you'll lose your braking
                    power. Safely come to a stop before this happens, and ride on flats
                    or uphill to drain the battery before attempting downhill again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>THE THROTTLE IN EXPERT AND PRO MODE IS EXTREMELY
                        SENSITIVE</b> to make the board responsive and fun, but it also
                    means fast or sudden inputs can easily cause you to fall off. Start
                    by trying to move forward as slowly as possible in these modes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>HILLS AND HIGH SPEED CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS</b> because
                    crashes can cause serious injuries, or worse. Be extra careful when
                    pushing the limits of the board, even if you're an experienced rider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>CARS AND OTHER VEHICLES CAN KILL YOU</b>, so always be
                    aware of your surroundings when riding in the presence of other
                    vehicles. Ride defensively and assume other vehicles can't see you.
                    Remember that your board may lose power and brakes at any
                    moment. Be aware of the laws that govern the use of your board
                    on public roads, bike paths, sidewalks, or other places that you
                    may ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET</b>. Other safety gear, like gloves, pads,
                    and long sleeves is highly recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>DO NOT RIDE WITHOUT READING THIS MESSAGE</b>
                    Whenever you ride a Boosted board, you risk death or serious
                    injury from loss of control, collisions, and falls. To ride safely, you
                    must read and follow all warnings and instructions in the manual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET WHEN RIDING!</b> Avoid water, wet surfaces,
                    slippery or uneven surfaces, steep hills, traffic, cracks, train
                    tracks, gravel, rocks, or any obstacles that could cause a loss
                    of traction. Avoid night riding, areas with poor visibility, and
                    narrow spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>WARNING:</b> Do not ride a Boosted board in environments, on
                    inclines, or at speeds where you would not be safely in control of
                    an unpowered skateboard. In the event of wireless interference or
                    battery fault, you may need to rely on skating techniques, like foot
                    braking or sliding to stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>WARNING:</b> AVOID WATER!
                    Your Boosted board is not waterproof, and riding on
                    wet surfaces can cause a loss of traction. Electronics
                    and motors are water-resistant to avoid damage from
                    puddles and wet roads, but the deck, bearings, and
                    other components can still be damaged. Damage to
                    the board due to water exposure is not covered under
                    warranty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>WARNING: PINCH POINTS</b>
                    Keep fingers, hair, and clothing away from belts, motors,
                    wheels, and all moving parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>WARNING: RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK!</b>
                    Do not open or tamper with electronics housings, which
                    also voids the warranty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>WARNING: ALWAYS INSPECT YOUR BOARD / REV BEFORE YOU RIDE!</b>
                    Check wheels, bearings, deck, and motors for signs of damage before you ride.  Replace as necessary.  If you ever have a concern please contact us immediately. 
                    Be sure all screws, nuts and bolts are tight. The streets that you ride on will cause excessive vibration and it is possible for these items to loosen over time, so check regularly. 
                    Please ride responsibly and respect those around you, both for
                    your safety and to help promote a new mode of transportation.
                </p>
